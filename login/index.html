            As Michael Jordan was entering his rookie year in 1984, he was approached by Adidas, Converse, and Nike to sign a shoe deal to play in their shoes. Nike made a compelling presentation in their meeting with Jordan, playing a highlight video of Jordan's various dunks and "anti-gravitational" moves scored to Jump (For My Love) by the Pointer Sisters, and showcasing the first design of the shoe. However, Jordan criticized the shoe for its colorway. Nike placed a great deal of consideration on Jordan's opinion and criticisms to create his "real signature shoe". While other companies saw Jordan as a figure for promoting preexisting shoe lines, Nike was determined to make him "a stand alone star and give him a signature shoe line."[6]

Ultimately on October 26, 1984, Michael Jordan signed a five-year, US$2.5 million deal with Nike, three times more than any other deal in the National Basketball Association (NBA) at the time. Nike released the Air Jordan sneaker line in April 1985 with the goal of making $3 million in the first three years. Sales greatly exceeded expectations, earning $126 million in one year.[7][8][9]

The NBA policy stated that the shoes must be 51% white and in accordance with the shoes that the rest of the team was wearing. Failure to follow this policy resulted in a $5,000 fine per game. Nike designed the Air Jordan I based around the Chicago Bull's colors, red and black, and only 23% white, which was a violation of that policy. Nike agreed to pay each fine, which ended up in a lot of controversy but also gained a lot of publicity for the shoe.[9] With the fines that the NBA placed on Jordan for wearing the shoes, it gave a unique trait to what people associated them with, as ground breaking since it broke the rules of the NBA.[10] They also took advantage of this marketing opportunity with the Air Jordan I "Banned" advertisement, which stated "On Oct. 15, Nike created a revolutionary new basketball shoe. On Oct. 18, the NBA threw them out of the game. Fortunately, the NBA canâ€™t keep you from wearing them. Air Jordan. From Nike."[11] The shoe ended up selling out 50,000 pairs and generated more than $150 million in sales.[12]

On September 9, 1997, Michael Jordan and Nike introduced Jordan Brand (originally called 'Brand Jordan') in a press conference he held in New York City. The shoes first appeared on store shelves on November 1, 1998.[13]
